# Notes on the models

LeNet-5 is described to have an error rate of 0.95%, however LeNet-5_200_Epochs.h5 has an error rate of 0.98%
LeNet-4 is described to have an error rate of 1.1%, however LeNet-4_200_Epochs.h5 has an error rate of 0.92%!
I'm sure there's a mistake somewhere
LeNet-1 is described to have an error rate of 1.7%, however LeNet-5_200_Epochs.h5 has an error rate of 1.38%!

Clearly there are some issues with my implementation. Alternatively, it could just be that the quality of the machine learning librarires have improved greatly over the last 2 decades.
